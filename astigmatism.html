     <h1>WHAT IS ASTIGMATISM?</h1>
       <p>Astigmatism is an imperfection in the curvature of your eyeâ€™s cornea or lens. Normally, the cornea and lens are smooth and curved equally in all directions. This helps to focus light rays sharply onto the retina at the back of your eye. If your cornea or lens isn't smooth and evenly curved, light rays aren't refracted (bent) properly. Doctors call this a refractive error.
       Astigmatism is a very common vision condition.Most people have some degree of astigmatism. Slight amounts of astigmatism usually don't affect vision and don't require treatment. However, larger amounts cause distorted or blurred vision, eye discomfort and headaches.
       A comprehensive optometric examination willinclude testing fro astigmatism. Depending on the amount present, your optometrism can provide eyeglasses or contact lenses that correct lenses the astigmatism by altering the way light enters your eyes.</p><br>

           <li>Eyestrain</li>
           <li>Headaches</li>
           <li>Squinting to try to see clearly, or</li>

        <p>If some of the lines appear blured you probably have astigmatism. Whatever your result, consult your eye specialist.</p>

        <p>People with natural clear vision see all the lines  in the same thickness and exactly the same spacing between the lines.</p>
        <p>If you find the thickness of all the lines is uniform if one line is black and clear and other is blurred then ther is possibilty of divergence of light in your eye.</p>
        <br>

        <h2>TEST 2</h2>

        <p>Look at the chart with your hand covering one eye.</p>

        <p>Close your right eye and see the image.</p>

        <p>Now close your left eye and see the image.</p>
