        <h1>WHAT IS MYOPIA</h1>
        
        <P>Myopia is the inability to see things clearly unless they're relatively close to your eyes. Also called nearsightedness or shortsightedness, myopia is the most common refractive error among children and young adults.
      
          Myopia occurs when the eye grows too long from front to back, causing light to come to a focus in front of the retina instead of directly on it. Other contributing factors include a cornea that is too curved for the length of the eyeball or a lens inside the eye that is too thick.
          
          Distant objects and your driving vision will be blurry if you have myopia, but you still will be able to see nearby objects clearly. This is why the condition is also called "near-sightedness.</P>

      <h1>Myopia symptoms</h1>
      <p>Chances are the only symptom is that more distant objects are blurred. You may also notice:</p>
       <ul>
           <li>Headaches</li>
           <li>Squinting</li>
           <li>Eye strain</li>
           <li>Eye fatigue when you try to see objects more than a few feet away</li>
           <li>Children with myopia often have trouble reading the blackboard at school.</li>
       </ul><br>
      
      <h1>INSTRUCTION</h1>
  
      <p>To take this test correctly, it is necessary to place yourself at ONE HAND DISTANCE from the phone approximately.</p>
       <ol>
         <li>Test your vision with adequate lighting.</li>
         <li>If you normally wear reading glasses or bifocals for near work, put them on to view the grid.</li>
         <li>Measure (or have someone else measure) a distance of about 16 inches from your eyes to the screen.</li>
         <li>Cover your left eye, but do not close it or press on it.</li>
         <li>With your right eye, stare directly at the spot in the center of the grid, and do not look away from this spot.</li>
         <li>As you notice the horizontal and vertical lines in your periphery. Ask yourself the following questions as you check each eye separately: Are any of the lines wavy, missing, blurry, or discolored?
           <ul> 
             <li>curved lines</li>
             <li>distorted lines</li>
             <li>broken lines</li>
            </ul>
         </li>
         <li>Repeat the test with your other eye.</li>
         </ol>
         <br>

         <h1>TESTING</h1>

         <h2>TEST 1</h2>

         <h2>TEST 2</h2> 
         <h1>Look at the picture of Albert Einstein</h1>

        <p class="text-align-center">If you're having MYOPIA then you will see anything else. Whatever your result, consult your eye specialist.</p><br>

         <h2>TEST 3</h2>  
         <h1>Look at the image</h1>

         <p>So if your vision is normal then you are able to see the black letters on both the screen i.e. red and green. But the words on red background is not clear then you have Myopia. But if the words on green background is not clear then you are having presbyopia which  is the situaton in which one losses the ability to focus on the object which is near to them due to loss of velocity in the crystalline lens of your eyes.It usually happen after the age of 45 years.</p>
